# Generate images of the Mandelbrot Set in Go!

This is a simple project that I've been wanting to do for a while, and since I'm currently learning [Go](https://go.dev/), I decided why not?

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project was to have something fun for myself to build so I could forget that I was learning Go... (even though I love go don't get me wrong). The secondary function is that you can generate images of the famous [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
