# Generate images of the Mandelbrot Set in Go!

This is a simple project that I've been wanting to do for a while, and since I'm currently learning [Go](https://go.dev/), I decided why not?

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project was to have something fun for myself to build so I could forget that I was learning Go... (even though I love go don't get me wrong). 

The secondary function is that you can generate images of the famous [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), which in my humble opinion is super cool.

> Aside:
> The Madelbrot Set, dispite it's name, was not in fact discovered by [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot). It was in fact discovered by both [Pierre Fatou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fatou) and [Gaston Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Julia), the latter being one of the only famous mathematicians to lack a nose! Other competitors for best noseless mathematician include [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe#Tycho's_nose) (although he only lost part of his nose, and he was more of an astronomer), and [Nicolas Bourbaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki) who never existed. Aren't you glad you read the README?

## Usage

Navigate to cmd/app and either run `make`, or compile main.go with `go build -o main main.go`. This will create an executable `main`. Run the executable and pass in any flags you want, to view flag parameters run `./main --help`. Have fun but be warned images can get very large!

## Contribution

If you want to go right ahead.
